# Module of 6 push-buttons with hardware bebouncing

This "mini-project" was inspired by [this tutorial](https://soldernerd.com/2014/11/12/switch-debouncing-using-74hc14/) and contains a few modifications:
- use either SMD ot THT buttons
- use either SMD or DIP IC
- add recommended diodes (but they are fully optional for soldering) as per [this](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5780/debouncing.pdf)
